# Student-Database
A console based application that parses data from a text file into individual arrays. The data is then able to be organized and output to a separate text document, alphabetically or by GPA (depending on what the user selects)

//   Latest Version Notes:
// - Fixed a bug where the print by GPA feature was not printing correct data
// - Updated the sorting algorithm to display GPA in decreasing order -- TODO: will likely add the option to print GPA in ascending order
// - Separate documents are now generated for the entire registry (creates "Master_Records.txt) and the individual student (creates "LastName_FirstName_Records.txt") 
// - TODO: If the user enters a valid last name and invalid first name it still returns the data of the student with a matching last name. It should only return data if both the first name AND last name match
